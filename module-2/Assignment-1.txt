Private Transactions Exploration

Objective:
The objective of this assignment is to give students hands-on experience with Quorum's private transaction functionality. By completing this assignment, students will gain practical knowledge of how to set up a Quorum development environment and conduct private transactions.

Instructions:

Setting Up the Quorum Environment:

Provide students with detailed instructions on how to set up a Quorum development environment. You can guide them on using tools like Docker or other suitable methods.
Ensure that the development environment includes multiple nodes or participants to facilitate private transactions.
Private Transactions Task:

Assign students the task of creating a set of private transactions within their Quorum network.
Specify the scenario for the private transactions. For example, it could be a simple transfer of assets between two participants while keeping the transaction details private.
Documentation:

Instruct students to document the entire process, including:
Step-by-step instructions on how they set up their Quorum development environment.
Details of the private transaction scenario, such as the sender, receiver, and transaction amount.
Privacy Configurations: Explain the privacy configurations used for the transactions. Students should describe how privacy was achieved, including the use of private smart contracts or confidential transactions.
Observations and Challenges: Ask students to document any observations or challenges they encountered while creating and executing the private transactions.
Reflection and Analysis:

Require students to reflect on the significance of private transactions in blockchain networks. What are the use cases and advantages of keeping certain transactions confidential?
Encourage students to analyze how Quorum's privacy features address the need for privacy in blockchain applications.
Submission:

Students should submit a report that includes their documentation, observations, and reflections.
Grading Criteria:
Evaluate students based on their ability to successfully set up a Quorum development environment, execute private transactions, and document the process effectively. Consider their reflections on the importance of privacy in blockchain networks and how Quorum addresses this need.
