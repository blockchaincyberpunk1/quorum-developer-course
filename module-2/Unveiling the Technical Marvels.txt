Privacy Marker Transactions: Illuminating the Path of Privacy:

Decoding Privacy Marker Transactions:

Privacy marker transactions are unique transactions that indicate the presence of a private transaction without revealing the actual content.

The Role of Privacy Marker in Quorum:

Quorum employs the concept of privacy markers to separate private and public transactions, ensuring that sensitive data remains hidden.

Preventing Public Visibility:

The use of privacy markers prevents private transaction data from being publicly visible on the blockchain.

Onion Encryption: A Layer of Security for Private Transactions:

Understanding Onion Encryption:

Onion encryption involves multiple layers of encryption, each corresponding to a participant in the private transaction.

How Onion Encryption Works:

The data is encrypted multiple times, and only the intended recipient can peel off the layers of encryption to access the private information.

Ensuring Privacy and Confidentiality:

Onion encryption guarantees that only authorized participants can decrypt and access the private transaction data.
