Exploring Tessera's Privacy Modes:

Defining Privacy Modes:

Tessera offers different privacy modes, each catering to specific levels of privacy and confidentiality.

Private Mode: Ensuring Full Confidentiality:

In private mode, only the participants involved in a private transaction have access to the encrypted payload data.

Restricted Mode: Controlled Visibility:

In restricted mode, participants who are part of the transaction's privacy group can access the encrypted payload data, enhancing controlled visibility.

Public Mode: Open for All:

Public mode is suitable for scenarios where transaction data does not require privacy and can be accessed by all participants.

Use Cases for Different Privacy Modes:

Private Mode Use Cases:

Private mode is ideal for confidential business agreements, financial transactions, and sensitive data exchange.

Restricted Mode Use Cases:

Restricted mode is suitable for scenarios where controlled sharing of data among specific participants is required, such as consortium networks.

Public Mode Use Cases:

Public mode can be utilized for scenarios that involve non-sensitive information and require transparency, such as public announcements.

Example Scenario: Implementing Different Privacy Modes in a Supply Chain Network:
