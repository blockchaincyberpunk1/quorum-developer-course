Open-Source Contribution to Quorum Projects

Objective:
The objective of this coding assignment is to motivate and empower students to actively contribute to open-source Quorum projects. By participating in open-source development, students can gain hands-on experience, collaborate with the Quorum community, and enhance their programming skills.

Instructions:

Introduction to Open Source Contribution:

Begin by explaining the importance of open-source software and its role in the Quorum ecosystem.
Emphasize that contributing to open source not only benefits the community but also provides students with real-world development experience.
Project Selection:

Provide students with a list of open-source Quorum projects or repositories available on platforms like GitHub. Include projects with issues labeled as "beginner-friendly" or "good first issue."
Instruct students to choose one project that aligns with their interests and skill level.
Issue Identification:

Ask students to explore their selected project and identify an issue (bug, feature request, documentation improvement, etc.) that they can work on.
The identified issue should be feasible for a student with their current knowledge and skills.
Forking and Cloning:

Guide students on how to fork the selected project's repository to their own GitHub account.
Instruct students to clone their forked repository to their local development environment.
Code Contribution:

Require students to make the necessary code changes to address the identified issue. They should follow best practices and coding standards relevant to the project.
Testing and Documentation:

Encourage students to thoroughly test their code changes to ensure they do not introduce new issues.
Instruct students to provide clear and concise documentation of their changes within the project.
Pull Request Submission:

Ask students to submit a pull request (PR) to the original project's repository, explaining the purpose of their PR and referencing the identified issue.
Students should actively engage with maintainers and address any feedback or review comments during the PR process.
Documentation and Reflection:

Require students to document their contribution journey, including the project selected, the issue addressed, and the PR submission.
Ask students to reflect on the experience, highlighting what they learned and any challenges they encountered.
Submission:

Instruct students to submit their documentation of the open-source contribution, including links to their PRs and reflections.
Grading Criteria:
Evaluate students based on the following criteria:

The quality and significance of the chosen open-source contribution (addressing a meaningful issue or enhancement).
The completeness and accuracy of code changes, testing, and documentation.
Active engagement with project maintainers and responsiveness to feedback.
