Real-World Smart Contract Proposal

Objective:
The objective of this assignment is to challenge students to propose a real-world use case that could benefit from blockchain technology and smart contracts, with a specific focus on Quorum's privacy capabilities. Students will be tasked with identifying a practical scenario, outlining the problem it addresses, and designing a smart contract solution to solve it.

Instructions:

Identify a Real-World Use Case:

Instruct students to research and identify a real-world scenario where blockchain technology and smart contracts could provide a meaningful solution. Encourage them to think about problems in various industries like finance, supply chain, healthcare, or others.
Outline the Problem:

Ask students to clearly define and describe the problem or challenge that the proposed smart contract solution will address.
Emphasize the importance of providing context and background information to help others understand the problem.
Design the Smart Contract Solution:

Task students with designing a smart contract that addresses the identified problem. They should consider Quorum's privacy-enhancing features in their design.
Encourage students to define the contract's functions, data storage, and any privacy settings required.
Privacy Considerations:

Ensure that students incorporate Quorum's privacy capabilities, such as private transactions or confidential contracts, into their smart contract design where relevant.
Ask them to explain how these privacy features contribute to the effectiveness of their proposed solution.
Proposal Document:

Instruct students to create a proposal document that includes the following sections:
Title and Introduction: Provide a title for the proposal and introduce the use case.
Problem Statement: Clearly outline the problem or challenge.
Smart Contract Solution: Describe the design and functionality of the smart contract.
Privacy Features: Explain how Quorum's privacy features are used in the contract.
Benefits and Impact: Discuss the potential benefits and impact of the proposed solution.
Conclusion: Summarize the key points and insights from the proposal.
Presentation (Optional):

Optionally, students can present their smart contract proposals to the class, explaining their use case, problem statement, and the smart contract's design.
Submission:

Have students submit their proposal documents or presentations for evaluation.
Assessment:

Evaluate students based on the clarity of their problem statement, the appropriateness of their smart contract design, their consideration of Quorum's privacy features, and the potential impact of their proposed solution in the real world.
Grading Criteria:
Assess students based on the quality and feasibility of their smart contract proposals, their ability to identify and define real-world problems, and their understanding of how Quorum's privacy features can enhance the proposed solutions.
