Secure Contract Upgrade in Quorum

Objective:
The objective of this coding assignment is to teach students how to perform secure contract upgrades on the Quorum blockchain platform. Students will be provided with a basic smart contract and tasked with enhancing the contract by adding new features or fixing issues while ensuring compatibility with existing deployments. Additionally, students will implement a secure upgrade mechanism to avoid data loss and write tests to confirm the successful upgrade and continued functionality of the contract.

Instructions:

Introduction to Secure Contract Upgrades:

Begin by introducing the concept of secure contract upgrades and why they are essential in blockchain development.
Explain that secure upgrades are necessary to introduce new features, fix bugs, or improve contract functionality without disrupting existing deployments.
Assignment Description:

Provide students with a basic smart contract that performs a simple function (e.g., a token contract or voting contract).
Instruct students to identify areas where the contract can be improved, such as adding new features or fixing known issues.
Emphasize that students must maintain backward compatibility with existing deployments of the contract.
Contract Enhancement and Secure Upgrade:

Ask students to enhance the provided smart contract by making the necessary changes and improvements.
Instruct students to implement a secure upgrade mechanism within the contract that allows for seamless upgrades without data loss.
Ensure that the contract can handle both old and new data structures.
Consider how storage variables, state, and data migration will be managed during the upgrade.
Testing and Validation:

Challenge students to write comprehensive tests for the upgraded contract to confirm its successful deployment and continued functionality.
Tests should cover both the old and new features to ensure that existing functionality remains intact after the upgrade.
Documentation:

Request students to document their contract upgrade process, including explanations of the changes made and the secure upgrade mechanism implemented.
Encourage students to provide clear instructions on how to perform a secure upgrade of the contract in a real-world scenario.
Submission:

Instruct students to submit the enhanced smart contract, the secure upgrade mechanism, the test suite, and the documentation.
Grading Criteria:
Evaluate students based on the following criteria:

Successful enhancement of the smart contract with added features or bug fixes.
Implementation of a secure upgrade mechanism that maintains compatibility and avoids data loss.
Completeness and correctness of the test suite, ensuring that all aspects of the contract are thoroughly tested.
Clarity and completeness of the documentation, including clear instructions for secure contract upgrades.
