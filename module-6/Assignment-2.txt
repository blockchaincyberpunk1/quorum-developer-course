Exploit Vulnerabilities

Objective:
The objective of this coding assignment is to enhance students' understanding of security vulnerabilities in smart contracts by having them actively identify and exploit a deliberately vulnerable smart contract. This exercise will also challenge students to propose solutions for fixing the identified vulnerability.

Instructions:

Introduction to Smart Contract Vulnerabilities:

Begin by providing an overview of common security vulnerabilities in smart contracts, such as reentrancy attacks, unchecked external calls, integer overflows, and more.
Explain the importance of identifying and mitigating these vulnerabilities to ensure the security of blockchain applications.
Assignment Description:

Present students with a deliberately vulnerable smart contract written in Solidity. The contract should contain one or more known vulnerabilities, such as a reentrancy vulnerability.
Provide students with the contract code and a brief description of its functionality. Emphasize that the contract contains vulnerabilities that need to be identified and exploited.
Exploiting the Vulnerability:

Instruct students to review the vulnerable smart contract and identify the security vulnerability present.
Ask students to craft malicious transactions or smart contract interactions that exploit the identified vulnerability.
Students should document the steps they took to exploit the vulnerability, including the code or transactions used.
Consequences of the Attack:

Have students describe the potential consequences of the attack if it were to occur in a real-world scenario. Discuss the impact on the contract, its users, and the broader blockchain network.
Proposing Fixes:

Challenge students to propose fixes or modifications to the vulnerable smart contract that would mitigate the identified vulnerability.
Encourage students to write updated code or provide a description of the changes required to make the contract secure.
Submission:

Request students to submit their reports, including details of the vulnerability exploitation, potential consequences, and proposed fixes.
Grading Criteria:
Evaluate students based on the following criteria:

Accurate identification and exploitation of the vulnerability.
Thorough description of the steps taken to exploit the vulnerability.
Clear understanding of the potential consequences of the attack.
Thoughtful and effective proposals for fixing the vulnerability.
Clarity and completeness of the submitted report.
