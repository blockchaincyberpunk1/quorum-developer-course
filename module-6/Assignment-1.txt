Secure Smart Contract

Objective:
The objective of this coding assignment is to enable students to write a secure smart contract on the Quorum platform while following best practices for security and avoiding common vulnerabilities.

Instructions:

Introduction to Secure Smart Contracts:

Begin by providing an overview of the importance of writing secure smart contracts. Emphasize the potential risks associated with vulnerabilities and security lapses in smart contracts.
Assignment Description:

Provide students with a simple smart contract template or describe a use case that requires a smart contract. Ensure that the contract includes functions and logic that allow for the application of security best practices.
Example use cases could include a basic token contract, a voting contract, or a simple supply chain contract.
Smart Contract Implementation:

Instruct students to implement the smart contract using Solidity, adhering to security best practices throughout the development process.
Emphasize the following security considerations:
Input validation to prevent invalid or malicious data from being processed.
Proper use of access modifiers (e.g., public, internal, private) to control access to functions and data.
Avoidance of common vulnerabilities such as reentrancy, integer overflow, and unchecked external calls.
Gas optimization to ensure efficient contract execution.
Testing:

Assign students the task of writing test cases to thoroughly test the functionality of their smart contract. Test cases should cover different scenarios and edge cases.
Students should ensure that their tests validate the contract's functionality and security measures.
Documentation and Comments:

Encourage students to include comments and documentation in their contract code. Comments should explain the purpose of each function, any security-related decisions made, and how vulnerabilities are mitigated.
Submission:

Request students to submit their secure smart contract code along with the test cases and any relevant documentation.
Grading Criteria:
Evaluate students based on the following criteria:

Adherence to security best practices.
Effectiveness of input validation and access control.
Mitigation of common vulnerabilities.
Thoroughness and effectiveness of test cases.
Clarity and completeness of comments and documentation.
