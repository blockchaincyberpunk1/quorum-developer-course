Auditing Smart Contracts

Objective:
The objective of this coding assignment is to teach students how to audit and analyze smart contracts for security and compliance. Students will be provided with a set of Quorum smart contracts and tasked with performing a security audit. This exercise will help students identify security issues, vulnerabilities, and propose improvements.

Instructions:

Introduction to Smart Contract Auditing:

Begin by introducing the importance of smart contract auditing for security and compliance.
Explain the role of automated analysis tools (e.g., MythX) and manual code review in auditing smart contracts.
Assignment Description:

Provide students with a set of Quorum smart contracts. These contracts may have vulnerabilities or security issues.
Instruct students to perform a comprehensive security audit of the provided contracts using one or both of the following methods:
Automated analysis tools: Students can use tools like MythX to automatically scan the contract code for vulnerabilities.
Manual code review: Students should manually review the contract code to identify security issues.
Identifying Security Issues:

Ask students to document any security issues or vulnerabilities they identify during the audit process. This may include issues like reentrancy vulnerabilities, unchecked external calls, integer overflows, etc.
Students should provide clear explanations of each identified issue and describe its potential impact.
Creating an Audit Report:

Instruct students to compile their findings into a detailed audit report. The report should include:
A list of identified security issues and vulnerabilities.
Descriptions of each issue, including the affected code.
An assessment of the potential risks associated with each issue.
Recommendations for mitigating the identified risks.
Proposing Improvements:

Challenge students to propose code modifications or improvements to the provided contracts that would mitigate the identified security issues.
Students should provide code snippets or descriptions of the changes required to enhance the contracts' security.
Submission:

Request students to submit their audit reports, including details of identified security issues and proposed improvements.
Grading Criteria:
Evaluate students based on the following criteria:

Accuracy and thoroughness of identifying security issues.
Clarity and completeness of the audit report.
Thoughtful and effective proposals for code improvements.
Demonstration of understanding of smart contract security concepts.
Compliance with audit instructions and guidelines.
